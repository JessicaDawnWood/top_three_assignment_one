    <h2>Orange</h2>
    <p>Oranges are a great fruit to start your day with or to give yourself a boost throughout the day. They are full of vitimain C which supports your immunsystem. They are also full of sugar which can give you that needed boost as you are falling alseep in your afternoon classes. Oranges are great when it comes to taste, when you can get good fresh ones. Every once in awhile you will get on that isn't good and it is hard to tell until after you have peeled it.</p>

    <h2>Apple</h2>
    <p> You know what they say, "an apple a day keeps the doctor away". Although this is not directly true apples are really good for you. They can lower the risk of diseases like diabetes and concer. Apples are a great source of vitamin C and fiber. They also are very low in sodium meaning they won't dehydrate you. Don't eat the apple seeds though, those can be dangrous. </p>

    <h2>Bananas</h2>
    <p>Bananas are full of potassium which helps with cramps. Therefore, if you are an athlete or someone who stuggles with muscuel cramps then banans can be your best friend. They are full of carb so be sure to add some protien to your diet in addition to the bananas such as peanut butter.</p>
