    <h1>Top 3 Pets for Campus</h1>
    <p>Here are our opinions on the Top 3 Pets to have on campus based on size and requirements.</p>

    <h2>Cat</h2>

    <p>Cats are very independent and great for those students who are not home often but needs a fuzzy friend to come home to. Cats tend to be on the smaller size, however, there are some large sized cats for those to want the look of a dog but the indepents of a cat. Cat also clean themselves so it is not big deal if you don't have a bathtub.</p>

    <h2>Dog</h2>

    <p>Dogs are great for those students who need for of the physical touch for a pet. Unlike cats, dogs can be relativly larger and take up more space. They are very co-dependent and need to be taken outside throughout the day. This also means on the cold days in the winter you'll have to go outside. However, dogs give eveyone attention and are more interactive unlike cats who are just there and will allow you to give them affection on their own terms.</p>

    <h2>Fish</h2>

    <p>Fish are the easiest pet you could have on campus. Just a little sprinkle of food every morning and you are on your way. They are there for you to look at and enjoy when you want, all of the othertimes you can just kind of forget about them. Their main expense is going to be food unlike dogs and cats who require food, vet bills, and groomers.</p>
