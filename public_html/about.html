    <p>I am a sophomore here at Simpson College and I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science or Computer Information Systems. I am from Juarez City, Chihuahua, in Mexico. I am in Web Development to explore possible career paths as I decide on a major. I am also minoring in music, I play the guitar and I sing. My favorite thing to do outside of school is playing video games and going out with friends. I also like to perform even though I am quite shy sometimes.</p>
